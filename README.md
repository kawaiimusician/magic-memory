# Magic Memory
This is a simple memory game I made following Net Ninja's tutorial which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCKohZwGZMw&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iQ7g2eoNXHCJBBBz40S_Lm)

In this project I was able to solidify my understanding of how to pass information from one js file to another in React and also learned more about the useEffect hook.
